Build and visit virtual places with d2vspace!

What if instead of visiting a web site, an internet user would
interact with a 3D virtual environment?

Such a digital experience would be more difficult to develop
than a regular web site. Would doeis it have any advantage though?

- 3D space is intuitive for humans, we have evolved to
thrive in the real world.
- Encoding information in 2D representation certainly abstracts
our minds from complexity and helps us focus in important aspects
of reality. But sometimes our representations become so abstract
that a person gets lost and confused.
- What if we could have the advantages of both worlds?

If we could encode websites in a 3D representation, the virtual
space could convey more information than the conventional 2D
representation without overwhelming the user.
